# neword
An Application which highlights words (based on your language level) on any website you visit (or your selected websites).
Words from word list (based on your language level which you choose) are highlighted with three different colors:
1. Yellow - word, which you never seen before.
2. Red - which indicates, that you failed to write the correct translation last time. If you will succeed to write the correct translation this time it will get yellow again. 
3. Green - which indicates, that you succeeded to write the correct translation correctly last time. You can still test your self.
4. Add ability to add word on website to dictionary 
Note: maybe we can add some other levels too.
